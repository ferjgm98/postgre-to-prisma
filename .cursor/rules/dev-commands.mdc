# Development commands

```bash
npm install            # install deps
npm run dev            # start dev server
npm run build          # production build
npm run preview        # preview dist
npm run type-check     # TypeScript diagnostics
```

## Expectations

- Keep TypeScript strict. Resolve type errors before committing.
- Do not introduce linter/type errors in edited files.
