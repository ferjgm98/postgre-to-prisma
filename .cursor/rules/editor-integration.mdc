# Monaco editor integration

- Register custom Prisma language and theme (`prisma-theme`).
- Dual-pane layout: left (SQL), right (Prisma output).
- Debounce input by 300ms before parsing/generation.
- Provide copy buttons for each pane.
- Surface parse/generation errors non-blockingly (toast/status), keep editor responsive.
