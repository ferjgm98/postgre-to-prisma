# Converter behavior

- Real‑time conversion with 300ms debounce.
- Show conversion status (ready/converting/error) and table count.
- Provide copy‑to‑clipboard for both SQL and Prisma outputs.
- Respect dark mode and responsive layout.

## Supported SQL features

- CREATE TABLE with PostgreSQL types
- Column constraints: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY
- Defaults including functions (e.g., CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- SERIAL/BIGSERIAL autoincrement
- FOREIGN KEY (inline and ALTER TABLE), composite keys
- Self‑referencing and many‑to‑many relations
- Enums via CREATE TYPE AS ENUM
- JSON/JSONB, UUID (with default), timestamps

## Prisma generation expectations

- Bidirectional relations with consistent field naming
- Proper attributes: `@id`, `@default`, `@relation`, `@map`, `@unique`
- PostgreSQL mappings (`@db.Uuid`, `@db.JsonB`, etc.)
- Correct optionality/nullable handling
